# aliasGenerator
One-click application that generates a random alias, can be filtered through some categories. Can also generate a list of all aliases.

## Technology Used
1. RandomUser API, most recent as of release is v. 1.3
2. Fetch API

## Endpoints Used
+ Default : https://randomuser.me/api/
+ Dynamic Gender Filtering: https://randomuser.me/api/?gender=${inputField}
+ Dynamic Nationality Filtering: https://randomuser.me/api/?nat=${inputField}
+ Dynamic Number of Results: https://randomuser.me/api/results=${inputField}

I tried to get the most out of using different endpoints available in the RandomUser documentation, which can be found here: [Documentation](https://randomuser.me/documentation).

## Hosted on gh-pages
